## Who Am I?
I founded the Arbenting Design Blog in 2005 and ran it until 2011 when I faced a massive case of burnout and needed a break, so I took some time off to finish my psychology degree. I graduated with my BA in 2020 just before COVID hit, so I had plenty of time to figure out what I wanted to do moving forward.

I discovered that, though I had a true passion for psychology when I started, academia was killing that passion with the depressing realization that most of the people teaching me didn't care much for the people they were claiming to want to help. Many seemed to really look down on them. So rather than continue into a graduate program I decided to continue my passion for psychology as a hobby and apply what I learned to my other passions, art, coding, and journaling.

I created <a href="https://www.hacktheplanner.com">Hack The Planner</a> for that side of me that loves pretty, artistic things and believes in the power of writing / journaling for personal growth. It also fulfills that side of me that loves cheesy puns and the movie Hackers. There I create planners and journals for fellow creatives, helping them organize their inherently messy lives and work toward achieving their life's purpose. 

I'm experimenting with learning in public at <a href="https://www.angiebowen.com">angiebowen.com</a> focusing on front-end web development, coding, and metacognition. I'm hoping to turn this space into a combination digital garden and coding blog.
